Examples

To run the example, just install this package and then cd into this
directory and execute a ``make``. This will install the js tools
needed to create the bundle and them will launch an HTTP server on
port 8000

Opening a page on that port you should see the background changing
every second form color to color. Opening the developer console, be
sure to enable "Javascript source maps" (in Chromium, in FF should be
enabled by default) and now you can follow the flow of the computation
on the original .py files. enjoy!
